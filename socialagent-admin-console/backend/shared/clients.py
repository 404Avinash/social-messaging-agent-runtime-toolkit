"""Cached boto3 client factory with adaptive retries.

Clients are keyed by (service_name, region). Cache survives for the
lifetime of the Lambda container, avoiding the ~100-300ms cost of
creating a new client per request.

Adaptive retry mode is AWS's recommended approach: it combines
exponential backoff with client-side rate limiting based on observed
throttling. See:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-retry-behavior.html
